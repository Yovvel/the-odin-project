        <h1>Zuurkool Stampot</h1>
        <h2>Sauerkraut-Potato Puree with Crispy Bacon</h2>
        <p>Sauerkraut has long been a vital source of vitamin C during cold Dutch winters, but the Dutch did not discover this wholesome food. In fact, it is said that the builders of the Great Wall of China kept their strength up with pickled cabbage. It is likely that Tartares brought the recipe for sauerkraut with them to Russia and Western Europe, where sweet-sour flavors were much loved in the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the increasing awareness of the health benefits of lacto-fermentation, old-fashioned fermented foods are once again gaining in popularity in the Netherlands, and beyond. Of course, today zuurkoolstamppot is mostly enjoyed for its hearty comfort in the colder months, but knowing it's good for you is heartening too. Traditionally sauerkraut stamppot is also served with rookworst, but we usually leave out this smoked Dutch sausage, because the bacon in the recipe already imparts plenty of porky flavor. </p>
