        <p>Hachee is a traditional beef and onion stew found in virtually every Dutch home.  It’s a delicious comfort dish to enjoy during the cold winter months.  The long, slow cooking time produce super tender meat and a rich sauce with wonderful depth of flavor.  Here is an authentic recipe that you’re whole family will enjoy.</p>
        <p>Eet smakelijk!</p>
        <p>The word hachee has its origins in the French hacher, meaning “to chop” and Hachee is sometimes referred to as a “hash.”  Hachee has been around since the middle ages and like many of the traditional dishes of Europe that we know and love today, it was originally a peasant dish, created as a means of using up leftover meat and vegetables.  The vinegar was used to tenderize tough pieces of meat (much like French peasants used wine).  Less expensive vegetables likes onions were used in generous amounts.  A long cooking process further ensured the meat would be tender.  Hachee remains a popular and much-loved dish in the Netherlands.  So much so that you can find it ready-made in grocery stores.  But nothing beats homemade, and your patience in the long, slow cooking process will yield results that you’re entire family will love.</p>
        <p>The flavor profile of Hachee is significantly different from the traditional beef stews we know here in the U.S.. Hachee uses equal parts of beef and onion and the onions are caramelized.  The featured flavors in this stew are cloves, juniper berries, black peppercorns, bay leaves and vinegar – all of which come together to provide a wonderful depth of flavor that is both rich and comforting.  The flavor of Hachee shares similarities with German Sauerbraten.</p>
